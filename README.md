# procedural-mesh-chunk
Little by little we are getting there. We made a cube in the last video. Now we make a chunk of cube meshes. We alter our algorithms to take into account array offsets, and position offsets for each cube procedurally generated to create a chunk of cubes mesh.  We can specify the dimensions of the chunk. We learn that Unity has a mesh vertices limit. We can use a 16bit or 32bit limit.
